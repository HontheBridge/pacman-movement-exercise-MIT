Pacman Movement Exercise

Introduction:
    This project is a simple file set of code in HTML and JS  that creates a small pacman movement scenario for your web browser.  The JS code allows for pacman to move back and forth accross the screen while simulating eating or choming.

Installation: 
    Installation steps for this project consist of downloading the file stack and saving into a folder directory on your local device. Once saved, open the directory in your preferred text editor and deploy a live server of the HTML file to watch Pacman chomp his way across the screen. NOTE: Please make sure that the images are stored in their own 'images' folder to ensure that the JS file is accessing them accordingly.

Usage: 
     This grouping of code not only demonstrates movement along the x-axis for an image and a turnaround/reversal, but is also a good way to practice referencing multi-dimensional arrays as well as learning 'on-screen' location referencing.

Support: 
    For suuport, please reach out to me directly over GitHub ('HonTheBridge') or over social media @MrJohnnyJohnson

Roadmap: 
    Future features and addons may include the following:
            - y-axis movement
            - speed adjustment
            - map development with walls
            - addition of Pacman's enemies - ghosts
            - powerups and bonuses for Pacman
            - scoreboard for tracking the players' success
            - music similar to the original Pacman soundtrack.

    This projects intent is for practice purposes only. The Pacman images were granted use through MIT and are intended to be applied in a learning environmenty.
